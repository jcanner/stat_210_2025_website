## The Beauty of RStudio Projects

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
An **RStudio Project** is basically a "flag" planted in a certain directory.

</br>

::: fragment
::: small
When you double click an **.Rproj** file, it:

1.  Opens RStudio

2.  Sets the working directory to be wherever the .Rproj file lives.

3.  Links to GitHub, if setup (more on that later!)

## RStudio Projects & Reproducibility

RStudio Projects are great for **reproducibility**!

You can send anyone your folder with your .Rproj file and they will be able to run your code on their computer!

## Principles of Reproducibility

You can to send your project to someone else, and they can jump in and start working right away.

. . .

This means:

1.  Files are organized and well-named.

2.  References to data and code work for everyone.

3.  Package dependency is clear.

4.  Code will run the same every time, even if data values change.

5.  Analysis process is well-explained and easy to read.

# Setting up an RStudio Project

Creating a new directory (a folder you **do not** already have)

![](../images/new-directory-rproj.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A picture of the option you would select when making a new RStudio Project for a folder that DOES NOT already exist on your computer. The image has a translucent blue cube with an R. The text next to the cube says 'New Directory' with a description saying 'Start a project in a brand new working directory'."}

## Bad practice

If you put something like this at the top of your .qmd file, I will set your computer on fire:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: set-wd

setwd("/User/reginageorge/Desktop/R_Class/Lab_1/")
```

. . .

</br>

-   This directory is specific to you!

-   Quarto will ignore this code when rendering!

## Good practice

Use the **here** package to load in your data!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false
#| label: using-here

read_csv(here::here("data", 
                    "rodents.csv")
         )
```

. . .

</br>

This path is *relative* to where your RStudio Project lives, which can be reproduced if you send your project to someone else.
