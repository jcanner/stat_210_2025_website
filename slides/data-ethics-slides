**Why do we (as statisticians, data scientists, folks working with data) need to think about *data ethics*?**

## Data Ethics

**Why do we (as statisticians, data scientists, folks working with data) need to think about *data ethics*?**

-   We have a lot of power to declare **truth and fact**, hiding behind the *black box* of data science methods.

## Data Science Oath

-   I will not be ashamed to say, **“I know not,”** nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed.
-   I will respect the **privacy** of my data subjects, for their data are not disclosed to me that the world may know.
-   I will remember that my data are not just numbers without meaning or context, but represent **real people and situations**, and that my work may lead to unintended societal consequences, such as inequality, poverty, and disparities due to algorithmic bias.

## ASA Ethical Guidelines

-   The American Statistical Association’s Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice are intended to help statistics practitioners make decisions ethically.
-   They aim to promote accountability by informing those who rely on statistics of the standards they should expect.
