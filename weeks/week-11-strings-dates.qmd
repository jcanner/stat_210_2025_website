This week is all about special data types in R. Similar to the tools you learned
last week for working with factors, this week you are going to learn about 
tools for working with strings and dates. By the end of this week you should be
able to:

+ Clean and extract information from character strings using `stringr`
+ Work with date and time variables using `lubridate`

# Part 1: Strings {#sec-strings}

Nearly always, when multiple variables are stored in a single column, they are
stored as character variables. There are many different “levels” of working with
strings in programming, from simple find-and-replaced of fixed (constant)
strings to regular expressions, which are extremely powerful (and extremely
complicated).

: Table of string functions in the R `stringr` package. `x` is the string or vector of strings, `pattern` is a pattern to be found within the string, `a` and `b` are indexes, and `encoding` is a string encoding, such as UTF8 or ASCII.

## Regular Expressions

Matching exact strings is easy - it's just like using find and replace.

```{r}
#| label: regular-expressions-first-look

library(stringr)

human_talk <- "blah, blah, blah. Do you want to go for a walk?"
dog_hears <- str_extract(human_talk, "walk")
dog_hears
```

But, if you can master even a small amount of regular expression notation,
you'll have exponentially more power to do good (or evil) when working with
strings. You can get by without regular expressions if you're creative, but
often they're much simpler.

# Short Regular Expressions Primer

You may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this
[web app](https://spannbaueradam.shinyapps.io/r_regex_tester/) built to test R
regular expressions. The subset of regular expression syntax we're going to
cover here is fairly limited, but [you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/regex?tab=Votes). As
with any tool, there are situations where it's useful, and situations where you
should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.

Here are the basics of regular expressions:

-   `[]` enclose sets of characters
  + For example, `[abc]` will match any single character `a`, `b`, `c`
- `-` specifies a range of characters (`A-z` matches all upper and lower case
letters)
-   `.` matches any character (except a newline)
-   To match special characters, escape them using `\` (in most languages) or 
`\\` (in R). So `\.` or `\\.` will match a literal `.`, `\$` or `\\$` will match
a literal `$`.

```{r}
#| label: phone-strings

num_string <- "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789"

str_extract(num_string, "[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]")

```

**Repeating Patterns**

Listing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify 
repetition?

-   `*` means repeat between 0 and inf times
-   `+` means 1 or more times
-   `?` means 0 or 1 times -- most useful when you're looking for something
optional
-   `{a, b}` means repeat between `a` and `b` times, where `a` and `b` are
integers. `
  + Note that `b` can be blank. So `[abc]{3,}` will match `abc`, `aaaa`,
  `cbbaa`, but not `ab`, `bb`, or `a`. 
  + For a single number of repeated characters, you can use `{a}`. So `{3, }`
  means "3 or more times" and `{3}` means "exactly 3 times"

```{r}
#| label: regular-expression-phone-ssn

num_string <- "phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789"

# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by a dash, 
# then a sequence of *two* numbers, followed by a dash, 
# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by a dash.
ssn <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}")
ssn

# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, 
# then a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, 
# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by any character, 
phone <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}")
phone

# Matches a sequence of *eight* numbers 
nuid <- str_extract(num_string, "[0-9]{8}")
nuid
```

**Anchoring**

There are also ways to "anchor" a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the
beginning or the end)

-   `^` has multiple meanings:
    -   if it's the first character in a pattern, `^` matches the beginning of a
    string
    -   if it follows `[`, e.g. `[^abc]`, `^` means "not" - for instance, "the
    collection of all characters that aren't a, b, or c".
-   `$` means the end of a string

Combined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of
semi-structured string data, such as addresses.

```{r}
#| label: regular-expression-addresses

address <- "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500"

# Match a sequence of one or more digits at the beginning of the string
house_num <- str_extract(address, "^[0-9]{1,}")
house_num


# Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma
street <- str_extract(address, "[A-z0-9 ]{1,}")
# Remove house number from street address
street <- str_remove(street, house_num) |> 
  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string
  str_trim() 
street


# Match one or more characters between the two commas  
city <- str_extract(address, ",.+,") |> 
  # Remove the leading and trailing commas
  str_remove_all(",") |> 
  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string
  str_trim()
city


# Matches both 5 and 9 digit zip codes found at the end of the string
zip <- str_extract(address, "[0-9-]{5,10}$") 
zip
```

**Making Groups**

-   `()` are used to capture information. So `([0-9]{4})` captures any 4-digit
number
-   `a|b` will select a or b.

If you've captured information using `()`, you can reference that information
using back references. In most languages, those look like this: `\1` for the
first reference, `\9` for the ninth. In R, back references are `\\1` through
`\\9`, because the `\` character is special, so you have to escape it. 

```{r}
#| label: regular-expression-fancier-r

phone_num_variants <- c("(123) 456-7980", "123.456.7890", "+1 123-456-7890")

phone_regex <- "\\+?[0-9]{0,3}? ?\\(?([0-9]{3})?\\)?.?([0-9]{3}).?([0-9]{4})"
# \\+?[0-9]{0,3} matches the country code, if specified, 
#    but won't take the first 3 digits from the area code 
#    unless a country code is also specified
# \\( and \\) match literal parentheses if they exist
# ([0-9]{3})? captures the area code, if it exists
# .? matches any character
# ([0-9]{3}) captures the exchange code
# ([0-9]{4}) captures the 4-digit individual code

str_extract(phone_num_variants, phone_regex)
# We didn't capture the country code, so it remained in the string

human_talk <- "blah, blah, blah. Do you want to go for a walk? I think I'm going to treat myself to some ice cream for working so hard. "
dog_hears <- str_extract_all(human_talk, "walk|treat")
dog_hears
```

Putting it all together, we can test our regular expressions to ensure that they are specific enough to pull out what we want, while not pulling out other similar information:

```{r}
#| label: regex-r-version-of-sas

strings <- c("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABAB",
             "banana orange strawberry apple",
             "ana went to montana to eat a banana",
             "call me at 432-394-2873. Do you want to go for a walk? I'm going to treat myself to some ice cream for working so hard.",
             "phone: (123) 456-7890, nuid: 12345678, bank account balance: $50,000,000.23",
             "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500")

phone_regex <- "\\+?[0-9]{0,3}? ?\\(?([0-9]{3})?\\)?.?([0-9]{3}).([0-9]{4})"
dog_regex <- "(walk|treat)"
addr_regex <- "([0-9]*) ([A-z0-9 ]{3,}), ([A-z\\. ]{3,}), ([0-9]{5})"
# Find patterns where two characters are repeated
abab_regex <- "(..)\\1"

# Create a table for whether each regex was detected in each string
tibble(
  text = strings,
  phone = str_detect(strings, phone_regex),
  dog = str_detect(strings, dog_regex),
  addr = str_detect(strings, addr_regex),
  abab = str_detect(strings, abab_regex)
  )
```

# Part 2: Dates {#sec-dates}

In order to fill in an important part of our toolbox, we need to learn how to
work with date variables. These variables feel like they should be simple and
intuitive given we all work with schedules and calendars everyday. However,
there are little nuances that we will learn to make working with dates and times
easier.
