# Reproducibility

# Reproducibility

> You should be able to send your project to someone else, and they can 
(re)produce the same plots / tables / results you did. 

## Principles of Reproducibility

- **Nuts and bolts**
  + [The documentation for a project should contain everything necessary (e.g., 
  scripts, Quarto files) to reproduce the results.]{.small}  


. . .

- **Portability**
  + [Any user should be able to run the scripts on their own computer or
  workspace.]{.small}

. . .

- **One-click Reproducibility**
  + [Reproducing all the computations should require (almost) nothing other than executing a single main script file.]{.small}


# How can a script I write run on someone else's computer???

# How can a script I write run on someone else's computer???

[Directories!]{.larger}

## What is a directory?

-   A **directory** is just a fancy name for a folder.

. . .

-   Your **working directory** is the folder that `R` "thinks" it lives in at
the moment.

```{r}
#| label: getwd
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false

getwd()
```

```
"/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/videos/week-1"
```

## Paths

-   A **path** describes where a certain file or directory lives.

. . .

```{r}
#| label: getwd-2
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: false

getwd()
```

```
"/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/videos/week-1"
```

</br> 

. . .

This file lives on my computer in my user files (`/Users/`),

. . .

on my account (`/jcanner/`), 

. . .

in my Documents (`/Documents`), 

. . .

in a series of organized folders (`STAT 210/videos/week-1`). 


# Managing Your Class Directory

## File Management Check-in

::: {.incremental}
- Your `STAT210` folder should live in your **Documents**.

- It should have a `Week1` sub-folder. 

- Inside the `Week1` folder, there should be a `Lab1` sub-folder. 
:::
. . .

::: callout-caution
# Your folder cannot synch with anything online! 

Your STAT 210 folder **cannot** be in a folder stored on Google Drive, 0OneDrive, or iCloud!
Storing your project in this location will cause your code to periodically not
run and I cannot help you fix it.
:::



# Scripts + Notebooks

## Scripts

-   **Scripts** (`File > New File > R Script`) are files of code that are meant to be run on their own.

. . .

-   Scripts can be run in RStudio by clicking the `Run` button at the top of the editor window when the script is open.

-   You can also run code interactively in a script by:

    -   highlighting lines of code and hitting run.

    -   placing your cursor on a line of code and hitting run.

    -   placing your cursor on a line of code and hitting `ctrl + enter` or `command + enter`.

## Notebooks

Notebooks are an implementation of **literate programming**.

-   They allow you to integrate code, output, text, images, etc. into a single document.

-   E.g.,

    -   **Quarto notebook**
    -   R Markdown notebook
    -   Jupyter notebook

We love notebooks because they help us produce a reproducible analysis! 

## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a *markup language*.

It uses special symbols and formatting to make pretty documents.

. . .

-   \*italics\* -- makes italics
-   \*\*bold\*\* -- makes bold text
-   \# -- makes headers
-   \![ ]( ) -- includes images or HTML links
-   < > -- embeds URLs

. . .

Markdown files have the **.md** extension.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto **unifies** and **extends** the R Markdown ecosystem.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "50%"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "The image displays a collection of hexagonal logos representing different R packages that are part of the R Markdown ecosystem. The logos from top to bottom, left to right, are: Xaringan, Distill, Blogdown, RMarkdown, Bookdown, Flexdashboard, Knitr, Rticles, RSConnect. These logos are arranged in a hexagonal shape, visually emphasizing the interconnected nature of these tools in the R Markdown ecosystem."
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_ecosystem.png")
```

Quarto files have the **.qmd** extension.

## Highlights of Quarto

-   Consistent implementation of attractive and handy features across outputs:

    -   E.g., tabsets, code-folding, syntax highlighting, etc.

-   More accessible defaults and better support for accessibility.

-   Guardrails that are helpful when learning:

    -   E.g., YAML completion, informative syntax errors, etc.

-   Support for other languages like Python, Julia, Observable, and more.

## Quarto Formats

Quarto makes moving between outputs straightforward.

-   All that needs to change between these formats is a few lines in the front matter (YAML)!

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Document**

``` yaml
title: "Lesson 1"
format: html
```

**Presentation**

``` yaml
title: "Lesson 1"
format: revealjs
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Website**

``` yaml
project:
  type: website

website: 
  navbar: 
    left:
      - lesson-1.qmd
```
:::
:::

## Quarto Components

![](images/quarto_sections.jpeg){width="80%" fig-alt="The image shows a split-screen view of a Quarto document editor and the rendered output in a browser-like preview. On the left side, the code editor is displayed, and on the right side, the rendered HTML output of the document. On the left, the top section contains the front matter, which includes metadata about the document such as the title ('Hello, Quarto'), the format (HTML), and the editor (set to visual mode). Below this, there is an R code chunk where R packages are loaded (specifically, 'tidyverse' and 'palmerpenguins'). This section is marked with `{r`} at the beginning of the code chunk, and the chunk is labeled 'load-packages.' Some options, like 'include: false', are present to prevent this code from appearing in the final rendered output. Following the code is Markdown content, which includes text descriptions and headings such as 'Meet Quarto' and 'Meet the Penguins'. There are also inline code elements and hyperlinks, like a link to the Palmer Penguins dataset. On the right side of the image, the rendered output is displayed, showing formatted text and visuals. The title 'Hello, Quarto' is shown as a heading, followed by a description of Quarto and a section discussing penguins. A link to the Palmer Penguins dataset is included, along with a colorful illustration of three penguins representing different species (Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie). Below this text, a plot is displayed, showing the relationship between flipper length and bill length for these penguin species. This image highlights how Quarto documents combine code, Markdown, and front matter to create a dynamic and executable report."}

. . .

**How does Quarto know that a section of text should be interpreted as R code?**

## R Code Options in Quarto

**R code chunk** options are included at the top of each code chunk, prefaced with a `#|` (hashpipe).

-   These options control how the following code is run and reported in the final Quarto document.
-   Some R code options can also be included in the front matter (YAML) which would be applied globally to the entire document.

## R Code Options in Quarto

<center>![](images/code_options.png){fig-alt="The image displays a table with two columns: 'Option' and 'Description.' It lists various options that can be used in code chunks within Quarto documents, along with their descriptions.The first option is 'eval,' which evaluates the code chunk. If 'false,' it only echoes the code into the output without executing it. The second option is 'echo,' which includes the source code in the output. Next is 'output,' which includes the results of executing the code in the output. The possible values for this option are 'true,' 'false,' or 'asis.' If set to 'asis,' the output will be in raw markdown and won't have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown. The 'warning' option includes warnings in the output. Lastly, the 'error' option includes errors in the output. It notes that enabling this option means errors while executing the code won't halt the document's processing."}</center>

## Chunk Option Completion in Quarto

<center>![](images/quarto_yaml_completion.png){fig-alt="The image demonstrates three different aspects of YAML code completion and diagnostics in Quarto. At the top, under the heading 'YAML completion for fields,' there is a code editor where the user is typing the beginning of an R chunk ('{r'). As they begin typing '#| e', a code completion menu appears suggesting YAML fields such as 'eval', 'echo', 'external', and 'error', among others. The highlighted field is `eval`, and a description in a yellow box appears, explaining that this option evaluates the code chunk, or, if set to 'false', it only echoes the code into the output. In the middle, under the heading 'YAML completion for options,' the code editor shows the 'eval' field typed out as '#| eval:'. As the user begins entering a value, a dropdown suggests the options 'true' and 'false' for the field, representing valid boolean options. At the bottom, under the heading 'YAML diagnostics for errors,' there is an example of an incorrect entry. The user has written '#| eval: FALSE' (with uppercase 'FALSE'), which leads to a red error indicator in the editor. A tooltip appears, pointing out the mistake and suggesting that the value should be lowercase 'false' instead. The image showcases how Quarto assists users with code completion, option suggestions, and real-time error diagnostics in the YAML section of code chunks."}</center>

## Rendering your Quarto Document

To take your *.qmd* file and make it look pretty, you have to **render** it.

<center>

![](images/render.png){fig-alt="The image shows the toolbar from an RStudio or Quarto editor interface. At the top, it displays the filename 'hello.qmd' (indicating a Quarto Markdown file). There are several options visible in the toolbar, and a specific button labeled 'Render' is highlighted with a pink outline. This 'Render' button is used to generate the final output (such as HTML, PDF, or other formats) based on the Quarto document. Additionally, there is an option for 'Render on Save,' which allows automatic rendering whenever the document is saved. The toolbar also includes options for adjusting the view between 'Source' and 'Visual' modes, formatting tools, inserting content, and running code chunks. The image emphasizes the 'Render' function, which is essential for compiling and viewing the Quarto document's output."}

![](images/render_on_save.png){fig-alt="The image shows a toolbar from an RStudio or Quarto editor interface, similar to the previous one. At the top, the filename 'hello.qmd' is displayed, indicating the file being worked on is a Quarto Markdown document. In this image, the 'Render on Save' option is highlighted with a pink outline, indicating that it is selected or being emphasized. This feature automatically triggers rendering of the document every time it is saved, which is useful for seeing updates to the output in real-time without manually pressing the 'Render' button. In addition to the 'Render on Save' option, the toolbar also includes the 'Render' button, formatting tools, and options for switching between 'Source' and 'Visual' editing modes. Other options for running code chunks, adjusting formatting, and inserting elements are also visible, but the main focus here is on the 'Render on Save' functionality."}

</center>

## Rendering your Quarto Document

Quarto CLI (command line interface) orchestrates each step of rendering:

1.  Process the executable code chunks with either `knitr` or `jupyter`.
2.  Convert the resulting Markdown file to the desired output.

![](images/horst_qmd_render_schema.png){fig-alt="A diagram of the proecess of rendering a Quarto document. First the qmd is passed to knitr or jupyter, then it is passed to markdown, finally it's passed to pandoc, resulting in a PDF, Word, or HTML output file." width="50%" fig-align="center"}


## Rendering your Quarto Document

When you click **Render**:

::: {.incremental}
::: {.small}
1.    Your file is saved.
2.    The R code written in your *.qmd* file gets run **in order**.

  -   It starts from scratch, even if you previously ran some of the code in RStudio.
3.    A new file is created.

  -   If your Quarto file is called "Lab1.qmd", then a file called "Lab1.html" will be created.
  -   This will be saved in the same folder as "Lab1.qmd".

# Version Control

# Version Control

> A process of **tracking changes** to a file or set of files over time so that
you can **recall specific versions later**.

+ A cloud-based service that lets you use git across many computers.
+ Basic services are free, advanced services are paid (like RStudio!). 
+ GitHub is remote.

:::
::::


## Why Learn GitHub?

1. GitHub provides a structured way for tracking changes to files over the course of a project.
  + *Think Google Docs or Dropbox history, but more structured and powerful!*

2. GitHub makes it easy to have multiple people working on the same files at the same time.

3. You can host a URL of fun things (like the class text, these slides, the course website, etc.) with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).


## Git Repositories

Git is based on **repositories**.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}

+ Think of a repository (**repo**) as a directory (folder) for a single project.
  + This directory will likely contain code, documentation, data, to do lists, etc. associated with the project.
  + You can link a local repo with a remote copy.

:::
::: {.column width="20%"}

:::
::::

<!-- ## `.gitignore` -->

<!-- Sometimes there are files that you **do not** want to track. -->

<!-- + A `.gitignore` file specifies the files that git should intentionally ignore. -->
<!-- + Often these are machine generated files (e.g., `/bin`, `.DS_Store`) or files/directories that you do not want to be shared (e.g., `solutions/`). -->
<!-- + **We want to ignore `.Rproj` files!** -->


# Actions in Git

## Cloning a Repo

:::: columns
::: column

<bR>

Create an exact copy of a remote repo on your local machine.

:::
::: column
![](images/git_clone_diagram.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A diagram of the process of cloning a repository. At the top of the picture, there is a cloud (representing the internet), with a pink box labeled 'remote' symbolizing the remote GitHub repository. There is a down arrow connecting the cloud to a laptop, mimicking the process of cloning a remote repository onto a local computer. The laptop has a greeen box labeled 'local' symbolizing the local copy of the remote GitHub repository." width="50%"}
:::
::::


## Committing Changes

Tell git you have made changes you want to add to the repo.

+ Also provide a *commit message* -- a short label describing what the changes are and why they exist.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

The red line is a change we commit (add) to the repo.

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

![](images/git-commit.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A diagram of the process of committing changes that were made to a document. On the left is a document with four lines of text. The third line is colored red, to symbolize where a change was made, while the other lines are colored black. There is a right arrow connecting the document to a laptop, with the phrase 'git commit' printed above the arrow. The arrow terminates at a green box labeled 'local' on the laptop, symbolizing committing changes made to the document to the local repository."}

:::
::::

. . .

The log of these changes is called your *commit history*.

+ You can always go back to old copies!



## Commit Tips

+ Use short, but informative commit messages.
+ Commit small blocks of changes -- commit every time you accomplish a small task (e.g., one problem in the lab). 
  + You’ll have a set of bite-sized changes (with description) to serve as a record of what you’ve done.
  + With frequent commits, its easier to find the issue if / when you mess up!


## Pushing Changes

:::: columns
::: column

<br>

Update the copy of your repo on GitHub so it has the most recent changes you’ve made on your machine.

:::
::: column

![](images/git_push_diagram.png){fig-align="center" width="75%" fig-alt="A diagram of the process of pushing local changes to the remote repository.

There is an arrow pointing from the laptop to the cloud with the phrase 'git push' next to the arrow, symbolizing the action of pushing the local changes (that have been committed) up to the remote repository."}
:::
::::


## Pulling Changes

:::: columns
::: column

<br>

Update the local copy of your repo (the copy on your computer) with the version on GitHub.

:::
::: column

![](images/git_pull_diagram.png){fig-align="center" fig-alt="A diagram of the process of pulling from the remote repository to update the local repository.

There is an arrow pointing from the cloud to the laptop with the phrase 'git pull' next to the arrow, symbolizing the action of pull the changes that exist on the remote repository (possibly from a different computer) to update the local repository." width="75%"}
:::
::::


## Workflow

**When you have an existing local repo:**

::: incremental
1. Pull the repo to make sure you have the most up to date version (especially if you are working on different computers).
2. Make some changes locally.
3. Commit the changes to git.
4. Push your changes to GitHub.
