**Investigate the full-time median price for childcare in a center-based setting versus the full-time median price for childcare in a family (in-home) setting in California. Pay close attention to the different developmental stages. Support your answer with one table of summary statistics and one visualization.**

+ Aim for about 150-300 words.
  + You should (1) introduce the data and the topic you are investigating, (2) discuss your table and plot, and (3) conclude.
+ This should read like a mini-report!
for readability.
+ Don't just have a summary table or plot show up "out of the blue" -- make sure
to build up to them with text, describe what they show, and provide captions.
