For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

# Part 1: GitHub Workflow

## Step 1: Making a Copy from GitHub Classroom

You can access the Lab 5 materials through the [Lab 5 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Statistical-Computing-with-R/lab-5). 

This week, to get a copy of the repository, we're going to follow a slightly different process. Use these steps to fork your own copy of the Lab 5 repository, then clone that repository into RStudio: [List of Steps to Fork GitHub Repository](https://scribehow.com/shared/Forking_a_GitHub_Repository__TKGOvrrYQ1GMfYCafxercg)

## Step 2: Making a Small Change

Now, find the `lab-5-student.qmd` file in the "Files" tab in the lower right 
hand corner. Click on this file to open it. 

At the top of the document (in the YAML) there is an `author` line that says 
`"Your name here!"`. Change this to be your name and save your file either by
clicking on the blue floppy disk or with a shortcut (command / control + s). 

## Step 3: Pushing Your Lab to GitHub

Now for our last step, we need to [commit the files to our repo](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first#stage-and-commit). 

## Step 4: Let's get started!

# Part 2: Some Words of Advice

-   Set chunk options carefully.

-   Make sure you don't print out more output than you need.

-   Make sure you don't assign more objects than necessary---avoid "object junk"
in your environment.

-   Make your code readable and nicely formatted.

-   Think through your desired result **before** writing any code.

# Part 3: Finding the Killer

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database
skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different
pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins,
driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png){fig-alt="This is an entity-relationship diagram that showcases multiple interconnected tables. The central table is labeled 'person' with attributes including id, name, license_id, address_number, address_street_name, and ssn. It connects to various other tables. One connection leads to 'drivers_license,' which contains id, age, height, eye_color, hair_color, gender, plate_number, car_make, and car_model. Another connection leads to the 'income' table, which includes ssn and annual_income. Additionally, the 'person' table is linked to 'get_fit_now_member,' which has id, person_id, name, membership_start_date, and membership_status attributes. The 'get_fit_now_member' table connects to 'get_fit_now_check_in,' which lists membership_id, check_in_date, check_in_time, and check_out_time. Another linked table is 'facebook_event_checkin,' containing person_id, event_id, event_name, and date. The diagram also includes an 'interview' table with person_id and transcript, a 'crime_scene_report' table with date, type, description, and city, and a small table labeled 'solution' with user and value attributes. The diagram visualizes relationships and interactions across these entities."}

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your
document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the
tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

::: callout-tip

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go
along.

## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in **all** of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or
remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

```{r}
# Code for looking at the relevant crime scene report.

```


**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**

::: callout-caution
Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!
:::

::: callout-note
## And the final suspect is...

*put the name of the person responsible for the murder here.*
