Write your own code to complete the steps, in the order given below.\n\nAdd 14 to every number.\nMultiply every number by 18, then subtract 257.\nUse the exp() function to exponentiate every number.\nSquare every number.\n\nHint: To update a vector after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with its updated counterpart. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x.\n\n## Code to carry out steps 6-9 \n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, there should be 352 numbers in the secret message that are below 17. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382. Name it “evens”. That is, “evens” should contain 2, 4, 6, 8 …, 382.\nSubtract the “evens” vector from the first column of your secret message matrix.\nSubtract 100 from all numbers 18-24th rows of the 3rd column.\nMultiply all numbers in the 4th and 5th column by 2.\nTurn your matrix back into a vector.\n\n\n## Code to carry out steps 10-15\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that at this stage of decoding, all numbers in indices 500 and beyond are below 100. Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: Use a relational comparison similar to what you used in the last checkpoint, but here you will need to subset values from your vector!\n\n# Write code to verify that indices 500 and beyond have values **below** 100\n\n\nTake the square root of all numbers in indices 38 to 465.\nUse the round() function to round all numbers to the nearest whole number.\nReplace all instances of the number 39 with 20.\n\nHint: Step 18 requires another relational comparison, but this time it is equality. Equality in R is checked with a double equal sign rather than a single equal sign!\n\n# Code for steps 16-18\n\nCheckpoint: Headquarters has informed you that your final message should have 344 even numbers.\nHint: Checking for divisibility is an interesting operation that isn’t done much in R. Modulus is the operation you are interested in, where you are checking for whether the numbers are divisible by 2, with no remainder. See what you can find about modulus in R!\n\n# Code to verify how many even numbers are in your top_secret vector"

No talking is permitted.\nYou may not point or signal to other players with your hands in any way.\nEach player must put together their own circle. No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces—one at a time—to any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you. As per the previous rule, you may not place a piece in another person’s puzzle; players must complete their own puzzle. Instead, you are expected to hand the piece to the other player."

So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore.\n[This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn’t play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nIn this class, we will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na “Stat 210” folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 210\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)\na separate R Studio Project (and GitHub repository) associated with each assignment\n\nFor example, if you come to my office for help on your lab assignment for Week 2, I would expect your files to look like this:\n\nFile Storage on WindowsFile Storage on a Mac\n\n\n\nThis computer has six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 311.” You should have one that is called “STAT 210” or something similar.\n\nInside my STAT course folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.” You can tell what folders Lab 1 lives inside based on the information included at the top of the screen. This is called a “file path,” which tells your computer where a folder / file lives on the computer.\nOn a PC, every file lives on the C Drive, so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\nC:/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/Week 1/Lab 1\n\n\n\nOn this Mac, there are six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.” Inside this folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.”\nOn a Mac, every file lives on the hard drive (it doesn’t have letters like a PC), so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder on a Mac would be:\n/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/Week 1/Lab 1",
