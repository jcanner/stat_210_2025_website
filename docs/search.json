A list is a “vector”, but it is not an atomic vector - that is, it does not necessarily contain things that are all the same type.\n\nmylist &lt;- list(\n    logicals = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE), \n    numeric_vec = 1:12, \n    third_thing = letters[1:2]\n    )\n\nmylist\n\n$logicals\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n$numeric_vec\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\n$third_thing\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\nList components may have names (or not), be homogeneous (or not), have the same length (or not).\n\nIndexing\nIndexing necessarily differs between R and Python, and since the list types are also somewhat different (e.g. lists cannot be named in python), we will treat list indexing in the two languages separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn unusual pepper shaker which we’ll call pepper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a list is indexed with single brackets, pepper[1], the return value is always a list containing the selected element(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a list is indexed with double brackets, pepper[[1]], the return value is the selected element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo actually access the pepper, we have to use double indexing and index both the list object and the sub-object, as in pepper[[1]][[1]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The types of indexing are made most memorable with a fantastic visual example from Grolemund and Wickham (2017), which I have repeated here.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 ways to index a list:\n\nWith single square brackets, just like we index atomic vectors. In this case, the return value is always a list.\n\n\nmylist[1]\n\n$logicals\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nmylist[2]\n\n$numeric_vec\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\nmylist[c(T, F, T)]\n\n$logicals\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n$third_thing\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\n\nWith double square brackets. In this case, the return value is the thing inside the specified position in the list, but you also can only get one entry in the main list at a time. You can also get things by name.\n\n\nmylist[[1]]\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\nmylist[[\"third_thing\"]]\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\n\nUsing x$name. This is equivalent to using x[[\"name\"]]. Note that this does not work on unnamed entries in the list.\n\n\nmylist$third_thing\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\"\n\n\nTo access the contents of a list object, we have to use double-indexing:\n\nmylist[[\"third_thing\"]][[1]]\n\n[1] \"a\"",

    "text": "2.1 Is every function vectorized?\nShort answer, no. There exist occasions where you either can’t or choose not to write a function that is vectorized. For example, if the function you’ve written makes use of if() statements, your function cannot operate on vectors. For example, take the pos_neg_zero() function below:\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  if(x &gt; 0){\n    return(\"Greater than 0!\")\n  } else if (x &lt; 0){\n    return(\"Less than 0!\")\n  } else {\n    return(\"Equal to 0!\")\n      }\n}\n\nWhen I call the pos_neg_zero() function on a vector I receive an error:\n\nx &lt;- seq(from = -4, to = 4, by = 1)\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\nError in if (x &gt; 0) {: the condition has length &gt; 1\n\n\nThis error means that the if(x &gt; 0) condition can only be checked for something of length 1. So, to use this function on the vector x, you would need to apply the function individually to each element:\n\nresult &lt;- rep(NA, \n              length(x)\n              )\n\nfor(i in 1:length(x)){\n  result[i] &lt;- pos_neg_zero(x[i])\n}\n\nresult\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector initialization\n\n\n\nNote that I initialized a result vector to store the results of calling the pos_neg_zero() function for the vector x. Similar to C++ and Java, R is an assembly language that requires objects be created before they are used, which is why I couldn’t initialize result inside the for()-loop. Second, when I initialized the result vector I made it the size I wanted, rather than iteratively making it larger and larger (which makes operations incredibly slow).\n\n\nYes, I could have written a “better” function which used a vectorized function (e.g., case-when()) instead of a non-vectorized function (e.g., if()).\n\npos_neg_zero &lt;- function(x){\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))\n  \n  state &lt;- case_when(x &gt; 0 ~ \"Greater than 0!\", \n                     x &lt; 0 ~ \"Less than 0!\", \n                     .default = \"Equal to 0!\")\n  return(state)\n}\n\nWhen I call this function on the vector x, I no longer receive an error:\n\npos_neg_zero(x)\n\n[1] \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"    \"Less than 0!\"   \n[5] \"Equal to 0!\"     \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\" \"Greater than 0!\"\n[9] \"Greater than 0!\"\n\n\nThat’s because the case_when() is vectorized!",

    "text": "2.2 When can’t you vectorize your function?\nIt is not always the case that we can write a “better” vectorized function. For example, let’s suppose we are interested in finding the datatype of each column in a data frame. The typeof() function can tell us the datatype of a specific column in the penguins data frame:\n\ntypeof(penguins$species)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nBut, I want the datatype of every column in the penguins data frame! But applying the typeof() function to penguins returns the object structure of the penguins data frame, not the datatype of its columns.\n\ntypeof(penguins)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nWhat can you do? Well, we could rely on our old CS 101 friend, the for()-loop:\n\ndata_type &lt;- rep(NA, \n                 length = ncol(penguins)\n                 )\n\nfor(i in 1:ncol(penguins)){\n  data_type[i] &lt;- typeof(penguins[[i]])\n}\n\n## Getting a nicely formatted table!\ntibble(column = names(penguins), \n       type = data_type) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = column, \n              values_from = type) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\ninteger\ninteger\ndouble\ndouble\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\ninteger\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, for()-loops are not as important as they are in other languages because R is a functional programming language. In fact, we would prefer not to use for()-loops as they do not take advantage of R’s functional programming. Take for example, our friend across() that we talked about at the beginning of this reading:\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    across(\n      .cols = everything(), \n      .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x))\n      )\n    ) %&gt;% \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspecies\nisland\nbill_length_mm\nbill_depth_mm\nflipper_length_mm\nbody_mass_g\nsex\nyear\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n11\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe across() function looks like an “ordinary” function, it applies a specified function / functions to the columns specified. However, when you look at the source code for across() you will find a for()-loop:\n\nfor (j in seq_fns) {\n  fn &lt;- fns[[j]]\n  out[[k]] &lt;- fn(col, ...)\n  k &lt;- k + 1L\n  }\n\nThis shows you that it is possible to include for()-loops in a function, and call that function instead of using the for()-loop directly.",

For example, If we wanted to standardize a numeric variable to be centered at the mean and scaled by the standard deviation, we could use the following function:\n\n\nstandardize &lt;- function(vec) {\n  stopifnot(is.numeric(vec))\n  \n  # Center with mean\n  deviations &lt;- vec - mean(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  # Scale with standard deviation\n  newdata &lt;- deviations / sd(vec, na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  return(newdata)\n}\n\nWhy does the following return a vector of NAs?\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    body_mass_g = map_dbl(body_mass_g, standardize)\n  )\n\n\nBecause body_mass_g needs to be passed to standardize() as an argument\nBecause mutate() operates on rows, so map_dbl() is supplying standardize() with one row of body_mass_g at a time\nBecause map_dbl() only takes one input, so you need to use map2_dbl() instead\nBecause there is no function named standardize(), so it cannot be applied to the body_mass_g column\nbody_mass_g is not a data frame so it is not a valid argument for map_dbl()\n\n\nThus far in the course, we have used the across() function to apply the same function to multiple columns. For example, if we wanted to apply the standardize() function from above to every numeric column, we could use the following code:\n\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(.cols = where(is.numeric), \n                .fns = standardize)\n         )\n\n# A tibble: 344 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.883         0.784            -1.42      -0.563 \n 2 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.810         0.126            -1.06      -0.501 \n 3 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.663         0.430            -0.421     -1.19  \n 4 Adelie  Torgersen         NA            NA                NA         NA     \n 5 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.32          1.09             -0.563     -0.937 \n 6 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.847         1.75             -0.776     -0.688 \n 7 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.920         0.329            -1.42      -0.719 \n 8 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.865         1.24             -0.421      0.590 \n 9 Adelie  Torgersen         -1.80          0.480            -0.563     -0.906 \n10 Adelie  Torgersen         -0.352         1.54             -0.776      0.0602\n# ℹ 334 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWhich of the following map functions would return the same output?\n\n## Option (a)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize)\n\n## Option (b)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_at(.at = c(\"bill_length_mm\", \n                 \"bill_depth_mm\", \n                 \"flipper_length_mm\", \n                 \"body_mass_g\"), \n         .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()\n\n## Option (c)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) \n\n## Option (d)\npenguins |&gt; \n  map_if(.p = is.numeric, .f = standardize) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols()",

Write a function called shorten(). This function should take in a vector, drop all values BEFORE the cumulative sum is greater than a provided number, and return the remaining values from the original vector.\nHint: Do not use a while() loop to do this!

One way to approach seeing what each line does is to highlight the code from before the pipe of that line up to the data unvotes and use CTRL + ENTER to run just the highlighted lines.\n\nunvotes |&gt; \n  count(country, vote) |&gt; #comment\n  group_by(country) |&gt; #comment\n  mutate(total = sum(n)) |&gt; #comment \n  mutate(prop_vote = n/total) |&gt; #comment\n  filter(country %in% c(\"United States\", \"Canada\", \n                        \"Germany\", \"France\",\n                        \"Italy\", \"Japan\",\n                        \"United Kingdom\")) |&gt; #comment\n  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = prop_vote, \n             fill = vote)) + #comment\n  geom_col(position = position_stack()) + #comment\n  labs(x = \"Group of Seven Countries\",\n       y = \"Proportion of Votes\",\n       title = \"Voting Record of the G7\",\n       fill = \"Vote\") + #comment\n  theme_minimal() +  #comment\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) + #comment\n  coord_flip() #comment\n\n\nDescribe what the graph above demonstrates above UN voting records for the G7\n\n\n\n\nRoll Calls\nThe second data set, roll_calls has more information on the type of vote, the importance, whether it was a resolution, and date of the vote. What does eh following code do?\n\nroll_calls |&gt; \n  distinct(short)\n\n\nDescription of code results\n\nWe can use the individual data for roll_calls to look at the number of votes per year over time.\n\nroll_calls |&gt; \n  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) |&gt; #extracts the year from the date value and creates a new `year` column\n  count(year) |&gt; #counts how many votes there were per year assuming each line is an single voting instance\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Number of Votes\",\n       title = \"UN Votes per Year\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWhat information is missing from the above graphic that might be useful in understanding the issues the UN commonly votes on?\n\nInsert Answer Here\n\nWe could try and look at the short descriptions, short, for each vote with the following code.\n\nroll_calls |&gt; \n  count(short)\n\nDoes the above information help us understand the voting issues of the UN over time? Explain.\n\nInsert your answer here\n\n\n\n\nIssues\nFinally we have the issues data which provides a more general description for each vote on specific issues. Note that not all issues are included in the data set, just the ones related to the 6 issues below:\n\nissues |&gt; \n  count(issue)\n\nIt would be helpful to use the issues data with the roll_calls data to be able to better understand the voting trends within the UN on at least these 6 issues. To do this, we need to join the data."

To work with this data, we’ll need to transform each table so that there is a column indicating which year an observation is from, and then merge the two tables together by country and year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5\n\n\ncountry\ncentury\nyear\nrate\n\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\n19\n99\n745/19987071\n\n\nAfghanistan\n20\n00\n2666/20595360\n\n\nBrazil\n19\n99\n37737/172006362\n\n\nBrazil\n20\n00\n80488/174504898\n\n\nChina\n19\n99\n212258/1272915272\n\n\nChina\n20\n00\n213766/1280428583\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5 is very similar to Table 3, but the year has been separated into two columns - century, and year. This is more common with year, month, and day in separate columns (or date and time in separate columns), often to deal with the fact that spreadsheets don’t always handle dates the way you’d hope they would.\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world, all data would come in the right format for our needs, but this is often not the case. We will spend the next few weeks learning about how to use R to reformat our data to follow the tidy data framework and see why this is so important. By the end of this chapter, you will have the skills needed to wrangle and transform the most common “messy” data sets into “tidy” form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we always want our data in the same layout?\n\n\n\nThe concept of tidy data is useful for mapping variables from the data set to elements in a graph, specifications of a model, or aggregating to create summaries. However, what is considered to be “tidy data” format for one task, might not be in the correct “tidy data” format for a different task. It is important for you to consider the end goal when restructuring your data.\nPart of this course is building the skills for you to be able to map your data operation steps from an original data set to the correct format (and output).",

However, with ggplot we can add the raw points on top of the boxplots!\n10. Add another layer to your previous plot that plots each observation using geom_point().\n\nAlright, this should look less than optimal. Your points should appear rather stacked on top of each other. To make them less stacked, we need to jitter them a bit, using geom_jitter().\n11. Remove the previous layer and include a geom_jitter() layer instead.\n\nThat should look a bit better! But its really hard to see the points when everything is black.\n12. Set the color aesthetic in geom_jitter() to change the color of the points and add set the alpha aesthetic to add transparency. You are welcome to use whatever color you wish! Some of my favorites are “springgreen4” and “steelblue4”. Check them out on R Charts\n\nGreat! Now that you can see the points, you should notice something odd: there are two colors of points still being plotted. Some of the observations are being plotted twice, once from geom_boxplot() as outliers and again from geom_jitter()!\n13. Inspect the help file for geom_boxplot() and see how you can remove the outliers from being plotted by geom_boxplot(). Make this change in your code!\n\nSome small changes can make big differences to plots. One of these changes are better labels for a plot’s axes and legend.\n14. Modify the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(y\\)-axis labels to describe what is being plotted. Be sure to include any necessary units! You might also be getting overlap in the species names – use theme(axis.text.x = ____) or theme(axis.text.y = ____) to turn the species axis labels 45 degrees.\n\nSome people (and journals) prefer for boxplots to be stacked with a specific orientation! Let’s practice changing the orientation of our boxplots.\n15. Now copy-paste your boxplot code you’ve been adding to above. Flip the orientation of your boxplots. If you created horizontally stacked boxplots, your boxplots should now be stacked vertically. If you had vertically stacked boxplots, you should now stack your boxplots horizontally!\nNotice how vertically stacked boxplots make the species labels more readable than horizontally stacked boxplots (even when the axis labels are rotated).

Don’t worry – there are many other color palettes available to use!\nYou can change the colors used by ggplot() in a few different ways.\n\nManual Specification\nAdd the scale_color_manual() or scale_fill_manual() functions to your plot and directly specify the colors you want to use. You can either:\n\ndefine a vector of colors within the scale functions (e.g. values = c(\"blue\", \"black\", \"red\", \"green\")) OR\ncreate a vector of colors using hex numbers and store that vector as a variable. Then, call that vector in the scale_color_manual() function.\n\nHere are some example hex color schemes:\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with gray:\ncdPalette_grey &lt;- c(\"#999999\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n# A vector of a RG color deficient friendly palette with black:\ncdPalette_blk &lt;- c(\"#000000\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in using specific hex colors, I like the image color picker app to find the colors I want.\n\n\n\n\nPackage Specification\nWhile manual specification may be necessary for some contexts, it can be a real pain to handpick 5+ colors. This is where color scales built-in to R packages come in handy! Popular packages for colors include:\n\nRColorBrewer – change colors by using scale_fill_brewer() or scale_colour_brewer().\nviridis – change colors by using scale_colour_viridis_d() for discrete data, scale_colour_viridis_c() for continuous data.\nggsci – change colors by using scale_color_&lt;PALNAME&gt;() or scale_fill_&lt;PALNAME&gt;(), where you specify the name of the palette you wish to use (e.g. scale_color_aaas()).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis website provides an exhaustive list of color themes available through various packages.\n\n\n\nIn this challenge you are expected to use this information to modify the boxplots you created Lab 3.

Do you want to go for a walk?\"\ndog_hears &lt;- str_extract(human_talk, \"walk\")\ndog_hears\n\n[1] \"walk\"\n\n\nBut, if you can master even a small amount of regular expression notation, you’ll have exponentially more power to do good (or evil) when working with strings. You can get by without regular expressions if you’re creative, but often they’re much simpler.\n\n📖 Recommended Reading: R4DS Chapter 15 (Regular Expressions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead at least through Section 15.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort Regular Expressions Primer\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it helpful to follow along with this section using this web app built to test R regular expressions. The subset of regular expression syntax we’re going to cover here is fairly limited, but you can find regular expressions to do just about anything string-related. As with any tool, there are situations where it’s useful, and situations where you should not use a regular expression, no matter how much you want to.\nHere are the basics of regular expressions:\n\n[] enclose sets of characters\nFor example, [abc] will match any single character a, b, c\n- specifies a range of characters (A-z matches all upper and lower case letters)\n. matches any character (except a newline)\nTo match special characters, escape them using \\ (in most languages) or \\\\ (in R). So \\. or \\\\. will match a literal ., \\$ or \\\\$ will match a literal $.\n\n\nnum_string &lt;- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\nstr_extract(num_string, \"[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\")\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n\nRepeating Patterns\nListing out all of those numbers can get repetitive, though. How do we specify repetition?\n\n* means repeat between 0 and inf times\n+ means 1 or more times\n? means 0 or 1 times – most useful when you’re looking for something optional\n{a, b} means repeat between a and b times, where a and b are integers. `\nNote that b can be blank. So [abc]{3,} will match abc, aaaa, cbbaa, but not ab, bb, or a.\nFor a single number of repeated characters, you can use {a}. So {3, } means “3 or more times” and {3} means “exactly 3 times”\n\n\nnum_string &lt;- \"phone: 123-456-7890, nuid: 12345678, ssn: 123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *two* numbers, followed by a dash, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by a dash.\nssn &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\")\nssn\n\n[1] \"123-45-6789\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *three* numbers, followed by any character, \n# then a sequence of *four* numbers, followed by any character, \nphone &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{3}.[0-9]{4}\")\nphone\n\n[1] \"123-456-7890\"\n\n# Matches a sequence of *eight* numbers \nnuid &lt;- str_extract(num_string, \"[0-9]{8}\")\nnuid\n\n[1] \"12345678\"\n\n\nAnchoring\nThere are also ways to “anchor” a pattern to a part of the string (e.g. the beginning or the end)\n\n^ has multiple meanings:\n\nif it’s the first character in a pattern, ^ matches the beginning of a string\nif it follows [, e.g. [^abc], ^ means “not” - for instance, “the collection of all characters that aren’t a, b, or c”.\n\n$ means the end of a string\n\nCombined with pre and post-processing, these let you make sense out of semi-structured string data, such as addresses.\n\naddress &lt;- \"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington D.C., 20500\"\n\n# Match a sequence of one or more digits at the beginning of the string\nhouse_num &lt;- str_extract(address, \"^[0-9]{1,}\")\nhouse_num\n\n[1] \"1600\"\n\n# Match everything alphanumeric up to the comma\nstreet &lt;- str_extract(address, \"[A-z0-9 ]{1,}\")\n# Remove house number from street address\nstreet &lt;- str_remove(street, house_num) |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim() \nstreet\n\n[1] \"Pennsylvania Ave NW\"\n\n# Match one or more characters between the two commas  \ncity &lt;- str_extract(address, \",.+,\") |&gt; \n  # Remove the leading and trailing commas\n  str_remove_all(\",\") |&gt; \n  # Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from remaining string\n  str_trim()\ncity\n\n[1] \"Washington D.C.\"\n\n# Matches both 5 and 9 digit zip codes found at the end of the string\nzip &lt;- str_extract(address, \"[0-9-]{5,10}$\") \nzip\n\n[1] \"20500\"\n\n\nMaking Groups\n\n() are used to capture information.

Unlike other graphics classification schemes, the grammar of graphics makes an attempt to describe how the data set itself relates to the components of the chart.\nThis has a few advantages:\n\nIt’s relatively easy to represent the same data set with different types of plots (and to find their strengths and weaknesses)\nGrammar leads to a concise description of the plot and its contents\nWe can add layers to modify the graphics, each with their own basic grammar (just like we combine sentences and clauses to build a rich, descriptive paragraph)\n\n\n\n\nA pyramid view of the major components of the grammar of graphics, with data as the base, aesthetics building on data, scales building on aesthetics, geometric objects, statistics, facets, and the coordinate system at the top of the pyramid.

So, you need to remove the old version of R.\nTo do this you need to:\n\nNavigate to your computer’s settings\nClick on the “Apps” option on the left-hand panel\nSearch for or scroll down to R\nFind the older version of R\n\n\n\nClick on the ... on the right side\nSelect “Uninstall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are macOS user:\n\nClick on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”\nUnder “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number.

I recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing. If you can’t, then you can use Posit Cloud to run R and RStudio on a free server. However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all times to do your work.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a Linux user:\nClick on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.",

No talking is permitted.\nYou may not point or signal to other players with your hands in any way.\nEach player must put together their own circle. No one else may show a player how to assemble their circle or do it for them.\nThis is an exercise in giving. You may not take a piece from another player, but you may give your pieces—one at a time—to any other member of your group, and members of your group may give pieces to you.

The designer is then tasked with instructing the players how to replicate the design they created, but there are some rules.\n\nThe designer cannot touch the players shapes.\nThe designer cannot tell the players how to assemble the shapes into the correct design.\nThe designer can respond to questions posed by the players.\n\n\n\nPlayers\n“Players” are tasked with solving the design made by the “designer.” Players can pose questions to the designer to uncover their design. Once an player believes they have figured out the design, the designer should check their solution. If the designer says the solution is correct, then the player can assist the designer in answering questions posed by the other players.\n\n\nObserver\nThe “observer” is tasked with monitoring the interactions between the designer and the players. Specifically, the observer should check off the number of times they see two behaviors occurring, (1) explaining by telling how, and (2) everybody helps.

    "text": "1.1 File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore.\n[This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn’t play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nIn this class, we will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na “Stat 210” folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 210\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)\na separate R Studio Project (and GitHub repository) associated with each assignment\n\nFor example, if you come to my office for help on your lab assignment for Week 2, I would expect your files to look like this:\n\nFile Storage on WindowsFile Storage on a Mac\n\n\n\nThis computer has six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 311.” You should have one that is called “STAT 210” or something similar.\n\nInside my STAT course folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.” You can tell what folders Lab 1 lives inside based on the information included at the top of the screen. This is called a “file path,” which tells your computer where a folder / file lives on the computer.\nOn a PC, every file lives on the C Drive, so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder would be:\nC:/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/Week 1/Lab 1\n\n\n\nOn this Mac, there are six total folders in my Documents, one of which is a folder named “STAT 331.” Inside this folder is a sub-folder named “Week 1,” which also has a sub-folder (a sub-sub-folder) named “Lab 1.”\nOn a Mac, every file lives on the hard drive (it doesn’t have letters like a PC), so the “full path” to get to my Lab 1 folder on a Mac would be:\n/Users/jcanner/Documents/STAT 210/Week 1/Lab 1",

Create a ca_childcare dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) just the year and childcare cost variable information from the childcare_costs dataset.\nHint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations. The final data set should have study year, median household income expressed in 2018 dollars, all the variables associated with full-time median price charged for Center-based Care, and California county names\n3. Using a function from the forcats package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the 10 Census regions in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number. An example region has been started for you.\nHint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI have provided you with code that eliminates the word “County” from each of the county names in your ca_childcare dataset. You should keep this line of code and pipe into the rest of your data manipulations.\nYou will learn about the str_remove() function from the stringr package next week!\n\n\n\nca_childcare &lt;- ca_childcare |&gt; \n  mutate(county_name = str_remove(county_name, \" County\")) |&gt;\n  ...\n\n4. Let’s consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the median of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the region and the study_year. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions!\n\n\n5. Which California region had the lowest median full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this region correspond to the region with the lowest median income in 2018 that you found in Q4?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution. Consider using one of the slice functions.\n\n\n6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis will require transforming your data! Sketch out what you want the data to look like before you begin to code. You should be starting with your California dataset that contains the regions.\nYou will also be required to use functions from forcats to change the labels and the ordering of your factor levels.\nRemember to avoid “object junk” in your environment!\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot to recreate",

Estimates for regional military expenditure have been extended backwards depending on availability of data, but no estimates for total world military expenditure are available before 1988 due to the lack of data from the Soviet Union.\nSIPRI military expenditure data is based on open sources only."

Suppose we have a project we’ve been work on and we never created an official R Project for it (perhaps it is a folder filled with data sets or someone sent a zipped filed that didn’t contain an R Project file (.RProj).\nTo add a R Project to an existing folder on your computer (e.g., you already created a folder for the project), first open RStudio on your computer and click File &gt; New Project, then select Existing Directory:\n\n\n\nNavigation prompt for creating a new R Project in an existing directory\n\n\nThen, browse on your computer to where you saved your project folder (it should be on your hard drive and not on iCloud, Google Drive, or One Drive).

    "text": "The Data\nThe teacher_evals dataset contains student evaluations of reaching (SET) collected from students at a University in Poland. There are SET surveys from students in all fields and all levels of study offered by the university. 1\nThe SET questionnaire that every student at this university completes is as follows:\n\nEvaluation survey of the teaching staff of University of Poland. Please complete the following evaluation form, which aims to assess the lecturer’s performance. Only one answer should be indicated for each question. The answers are coded in the following way: 5 - I strongly agree; 4 - I agree; 3 - Neutral; 2 - I don’t agree; 1 - I strongly don’t agree.\nQuestion 1: I learned a lot during the course.\nQuestion 2: I think that the knowledge acquired during the course is very useful.\nQuestion 3: The professor used activities to make the class more engaging.\nQuestion 4: If it was possible, I would enroll for a course conducted by this lecturer again.\nQuestion 5: The classes started on time.\nQuestion 6: The lecturer always used time efficiently.\nQuestion 7: The lecturer delivered the class content in an understandable and efficient way.\nQuestion 8: The lecturer was available when we had doubts.\nQuestion 9. The lecturer treated all students equally regardless of their race, background and ethnicity.\n\nThese data are from the end of the winter semester of the 2020-2021 academic year. In the period of data collection, all university classes were entirely online amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While expected learning outcomes were not changed, the online mode of study could have affected grading policies and could have implications for data.\nAverage SET scores were combined with many other variables, including:\n\ncharacteristics of the teacher (degree, seniority, gender, SET scores in the past 6 semesters).\ncharacteristics of the course (time of day, day of the week, course type, course breadth, class duration, class size).\npercentage of students providing SET feedback.\ncourse grades (mean, standard deviation, percentage failed for the current course and previous 6 semesters).\n\nThis rich dataset allows us to investigate many of the biases in student evaluations of teaching that have been reported in the literature and to formulate new hypotheses.\nBefore tackling the problems below, study the description of each variable included in the teacher_evals_codebook.pdf.\n1. Load the appropriate R packages for your analysis.\n\n# code chunk for loading packages\n\n2. Load in the teacher_evals data.\n\n# code chunk for importing the data\n\n\nData Inspection + Summary\n3. Provide a brief overview (~4 sentences) of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is always good practice to start an analysis by getting a feel for the data and providing a quick summary for readers. You do not need to show any code for this question, although you probably want to use code to get some information about the data (e.g., summary(data), glimpse(data), dim(data), etc.). Things to think about – where did the data come from? what sort of data are provided (context and data type)? how much data do you have? etc.\n\n\n\n# you may want to use code to answer this question\n\n4. What is the unit of observation (i.e. a single row in the dataset) identified by?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is not one instructor per row! It’s also not just one class per row!\n\n\n\n# you may want to use code to answer this question\n\n5. Use one dplyr pipeline to clean the data by:\n\nrenaming the gender variable sex\nremoving all courses with fewer than 10 respondents\nchanging data types in whichever way you see fit (e.g., is the instructor ID really a numeric data type?)\nonly keeping the columns we will use – course_id, teacher_id, question_no, no_participants, resp_share, SET_score_avg, percent_failed_cur, academic_degree, seniority, and sex\n\nAssign your cleaned data to a new variable named teacher_evals_clean –- use these data going forward. Save the data as teacher_evals_clean.csv in the data-clean folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: rename(), mutate(), as.factor()\nIt would be most efficient to use across() in combination with mutate() to complete this task.\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q4\n\n5. How many unique instructors and unique courses are present in the cleaned dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHelpful functions: summarize(), n_distinct()\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q5\n\n6. One teacher-course combination has some missing values, coded as NA. Which instructor has these missing values? Which course?

Investigate the variables academic_degree, seniority, and sex and summarize your findings in ~3 complete sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to first wrangle your data to have each instructor represented only once.\nHelpful functions: select(), distinct(___, .keep_all = TRUE), count(), summarize()\n\n\n\n# code chunk for Q7\n\n8. Each course seems to have used a different subset of the nine evaluation questions. How many teacher-course combinations asked all nine questions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to first wrangle your data to find the number of questions asked within each teacher-course combination.

Write the code to verify that this is true for your top_secret object!\nHint: This is what is called a “relational” comparison, where you compare an object to a number and R will give you a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs based on whether the comparison is / is not met. You can then use these TRUEs and FALSEs as numbers, since TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0 in R land.\n\n# Write code to verify that there are 352 numbers with values **below** 17\n\nsum(ts9 &lt; 17)\n\n\nHint: To update an object after performing an operation, you overwrite the existing object with its updated counterpart. This looks something like this:\nx &lt;- x + 12,\nwhere the original value(s) in x have had 12 added to them, and the resulting values are put back in to the object named x. Be careful with this - if you do something wrong you will need to rerun the previous code chunks to reset everything! Fortunately, the grey arrow pointing down to the green line in each code chunk runs all previous code chunks again.\nNext, carry out the following steps:\n\nTurn your vector of numbers into a matrix with 5 columns.\n\n\nts_mat &lt;- matrix(ts9, ncol = 5) \n\n\nSeparately from your top secret numbers, create a vector of all the even numbers between 1 and 382.

What is happening inside the computer’s memory as goodpup() runs?\n\n\n\nA sketch of the execution of the program goodpup, showing that name is only defined within the local environment that is created while goodpup is running. We can never access name in our global environment.\n\n\nThis is why the distinction between arguments and parameters matters. Parameters are only accessible while inside of the function - and in that local environment, we need to call the object by the parameter name, not the name we use outside the function (the argument name).\nWe can even call a function with an argument that isn’t defined outside of the function call: goodpup(\"Tesla\") produces “Tesla is a good pup!”. Here, I do not have a variable storing the string \"Tesla\", but I can make the function run anyways. So \"Tesla\" here is an argument to goodpup but it is not a variable in my environment.\nThis is a confusing set of concepts and it’s ok if you only just sort of get what I’m trying to explain here.

    "section": "2.4 Scope",
    "text": "2.4 Scope\nWhen talking about functions, for the first time we start to confront a critical concept in programming, which is scope. Scope is the part of the program where the name you’ve given a variable is valid - that is, where you can use a variable.\n\nA variable is only available from inside the region it is created.\n\nWhat do I mean by the part of a program? The lexical scope is the portion of the code (the set of lines of code) where the name is valid.\nThe concept of scope is best demonstrated through a series of examples, so in the rest of this section, I’ll show you some examples of how scope works and the concepts that help you figure out what “scope” actually means in practice.\n\nName Masking\nScope is most clearly demonstrated when we use the same variable name inside and outside a function. Note that this is 1) bad programming practice, and 2) fairly easily avoided if you can make your names even slightly more creative than a, b, and so on. But, for the purposes of demonstration, I hope you’ll forgive my lack of creativity in this area so that you can see how name masking works.\n\nWhat does this function return, 10 or 20?\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n\n\n\n\nA sketch of the global environment as well as the environment within myfun(). Because a = 20 inside myfun(), when we call myfun(), we get the value of a within that environment, instead of within the global environment.\n\n\n\n\n\na &lt;- 10\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  a &lt;- 20\n  a\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 20\n\na\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lexical scope of the function is the area that is between the braces. Outside the function, a has the value of 10, but inside the function, a has the value of 20. So when we call myfun(), we get 20, because the scope of myfun is the local context where a is evaluated, and the value of a in that environment dominates.\nThis is an example of name masking, where names defined inside of a function mask names defined outside of a function.\n\n\nEnvironments and Scope\nAnother principle of scoping is that if you call a function and then call the same function again, the function’s environment is re-created each time. Each function call is unrelated to the next function call when the function is defined using local variables.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR Function\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if aa is not defined\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  else\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n}\n\nmyfun()\nmyfun()\n\nWhat does this output?\n\n\n{fig-alt=” The image explains how repeated calls to the myfun() function in R yield the same output because the function does not create or store an object in the global environment. The function myfun() uses an if-else statement: if the variable aa does not exist, it assigns aa the value 1; otherwise, it increments aa by 1. Each time myfun() is called, a new, independent copy of the function’s environment is created. The image depicts two separate calls to myfun(), both initializing aa to 1 because aa is not stored in either the function enviroment (where the function looks first) or in the global environment (where the function looks next) and therefore does not persist between calls. As a result, aa is always reset to 1 during each function invocation, with no accumulation occurring across different calls. The image emphasizes that the local environment created by the function is temporary and does not affect the global environment.”}\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  if (!exists(\"aa\")) {\n    aa &lt;- 1\n  } else {\n    aa &lt;- aa + 1\n  }\n  return(aa)\n}\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Lookup\nScoping determines where to look for values – when, however, is determined by the sequence of steps in the code. When a function is called, the calling environment (the global environment or set of environments at the time the function is called) determines what values are used.\nIf an object doesn’t exist in the function’s environment, the global environment will be searched next; if there is no object in the global environment, the program will error out. This behavior, combined with changes in the calling environment over time, can mean that the output of a function can change based on objects outside of the function.\n\nPseudocodeSketchR\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function(){\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\nWhat will the output be of this code?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of the global environment at the time the function is called (that is, the state of the calling environment) can change the results of the function\n\n\n\n\n\nmyfun &lt;- function() {\n  x + 1\n}\n\nx &lt;- 14\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 15\n\nx &lt;- 20\n\nmyfun()\n\n[1] 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest it out!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the following function return?

    "text": "2.5 Debugging\nNow that you’re writing functions, it’s time to talk a bit about debugging techniques. This is a lifelong topic - as you become a more advanced programmer, you will need to develop more advanced debugging skills as well (because you’ll become more adept at screwing things up).\n\n\n\nThe faces of debugging (by Allison Horst)\n\n\nLet’s start with the basics: print debugging.\n\nPrint Debugging\nThis technique is basically exactly what it sounds like. You insert a ton of print statements to give you an idea of what is happening at each step of the function.\nLet’s try it out on the previous example (see what I did there?)\nNote that I’ve modified the code slightly so that we store the value into returnval and then return it later - this allows us to see the code execution without calling functions twice (which would make the print output a bit more confusing).\n\nf &lt;- function(x) {\n  print (\"Entering Outer Function\")\n  print (paste(\"x =\", x))\n  f &lt;- function(x) {\n    print (\"Entering Middle Function\")\n    print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n    f &lt;- function() {\n      print (\"Entering Inner Function\")\n      print (paste(\"x = \", x))\n      print (paste(\"Inner Function: Returning\", x^2))\n      x ^ 2\n    }\n    returnval &lt;- f() + 1\n    print (paste(\"Middle Function: Returning\", returnval))\n    returnval\n  }\n  returnval &lt;- f(x) * 2\n  print (paste(\"Outer Function: Returning\", returnval))\n  returnval\n}\nf(10)\n\n[1] \"Entering Outer Function\"\n[1] \"x = 10\"\n[1] \"Entering Middle Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Entering Inner Function\"\n[1] \"x =  10\"\n[1] \"Inner Function: Returning 100\"\n[1] \"Middle Function: Returning 101\"\n[1] \"Outer Function: Returning 202\"\n\n\n[1] 202\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Debugging Strategies\n\nDebugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. - some t-shirt I saw once\n\nThe overall process is well described in Advanced R by H. Wickham; I’ve copied it here because it’s such a succinct distillation of the process, but I’ve adapted some of the explanations to this class rather than the original context of package development.\n\nRealize that you have a bug\nGoogle! In R you can automate this with the errorist and searcher packages, but general Googling the error + the programming language + any packages you think are causing the issue is a good strategy.\nMake the error repeatable: This makes it easier to figure out what the error is, faster to iterate, and easier to ask for help.\n\nUse binary search (remove 1/2 of the code, see if the error occurs, if not go to the other 1/2 of the code. Repeat until you’ve isolated the error.)\nGenerate the error faster - use a minimal test dataset, if possible, so that you can ask for help easily and run code faster. This is worth the investment if you’ve been debugging the same error for a while.\nNote which inputs don’t generate the bug – this negative “data” is helpful when asking for help.\n\nFigure out where it is. Debuggers may help with this, but you can also use the scientific method to explore the code, or the tried-and-true method of using lots of print() statements.\nFix it and test it. The goal with tests is to ensure that the same error doesn’t pop back up in a future version of your code. Generate an example that will test for the error, and add it to your documentation.\n\nThere are several other general strategies for debugging:\n\nRetype (from scratch) your code\n\nThis works well if it’s a short function or a couple of lines of code, but it’s less useful if you have a big script full of code to debug. However, it does sometimes fix really silly typos that are hard to spot, like having typed &lt;-- instead of &lt;- in R and then wondering why your answers are negative.\n\nVisualize your data as it moves through the program.\n\nThis may be done using print() statements, or the debugger, or some other strategy depending on your application.\n\nTracing statements.\n\nAgain, this is part of print() debugging, but these messages indicate progress - “got into function x”, “returning from function y”, and so on.\n\nRubber ducking.\n\nHave you ever tried to explain a problem you’re having to someone else, only to have a moment of insight and “oh, never mind”? Hopefully so, because this is exactly how your pair programming sessions should be going! Rubber ducking outsources the problem to a nonjudgmental entity, such as a rubber duck. You simply explain, in terms simple enough for your rubber duck to understand, exactly what your code does, line by line, until you’ve found the problem. A more thorough explanation can be found at gitduck.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may find it helpful to procure a rubber duck expert for each language you work in. I use color-your-own rubber ducks to endow my ducks with certain language expertise. Other people use plain rubber ducks and give them capes.\n\n\nDo not be surprised if, in the process of debugging, you encounter new bugs. This is a problem that’s well-known it has an xkcd comic. At some point, getting up and going for a walk may help. Redesigning your code to be more modular and more organized is also a good idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking Minimal Reproducible Examples\n\n\n\n\n\nThese section is included as FYI, but you don’t have to read it just now. It;s important, but not urgent, if that makes sense.\nIf all else has failed, and you can’t figure out what is causing your error, it’s probably time to ask for help. If you have a friend or buddy that knows the language you’re working in, by all means ask for help sooner - use them as a rubber duck if you have to. But when you ask for help online, often you’re asking people who are much more knowledgeable about the topic - members of R core browse StackOverflow and may drop in and help you out. Under those circumstances, it’s better to make the task of helping you as easy as possible because it shows respect for their time. The same thing goes for your supervisors and professors. 🙃\n\n\n\nThe reprex R package will help you make a reproducible example (drawing by Allison Horst)\n\n\nSo, with that said, there are numerous resources for writing what’s called a “minimal working example”, “reproducible example” (commonly abbreviated reprex), or MCVE (minimal complete verifiable example). Much of this is lifted directly from the StackOverflow post describing a minimal reproducible example.\nThe goal is to reproduce the error message with information that is\n\nminimal - as little code as possible to still reproduce the problem\ncomplete - everything necessary to reproduce the issue is contained in the description/question\nreproducible - test the code you provide to reproduce the problem.\n\nYou should format your question to make it as easy as possible to help you. Make it so that code can be copied from your post directly and pasted into an R script or notebook (e.g. Quarto document code chunk). Describe what you see and what you’d hope to see if the code were working.\nOther resources:\n\nreprex package: Do’s and Don’ts\nHow to use the reprex package - Vignette with videos from the Jenny Bryan\nreprex magic - Vignette adapted from a blog post by Nick Tierney",

    "text": "5.1 Tidy Evaluation\nWriting functions that work with data frames and call on the functions we’ve become used to (e.g., filter(), select(), summarise()) requires we learn about tidy evaluation. To write these functions you will need to know, at a high level, whether the function you are trying to incorporate uses data masking or tidy selection.\nAt a high level, data masking is used in functions like arrange(), filter(), and summarize() that compute with variables. Whereas, tidy selection is used for functions like select() and rename() that select variables.\nYour intuition about which functions use tidy evaluation should be good for many of these functions. If you can input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function (e.g., select(mtcars, c(vs, am, gear))), then the function uses tidy selection! If you cannot input c(var1, var2, var3) into the function, then the function is performing computations on the data and uses data masking.\nIf you are interested in learning more about tidy evaluation, I would highly recommend:\n\nthis video by Jenny Bryan\n\nI do want to note that this video is from 2019 and some things have changed since then. Namely, we used to need to use the enquo() function to inject\nvariable names into dplyr functions, whereas we now use embracing {{}}. 🤗\n\nthis vignette for tidy evaluation with dplyr\n\n\n✅ Check-in: Writing Data Frame Functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Structure\n\n\n\nNote for Questions 1 & 2, I am assuming the flight data has a similar structure to the nycflights data from the openintro R package.\n\nhead(openintro::nycflights)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 16\n   year month   day dep_time dep_delay arr_time arr_delay carrier tailnum flight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1  2013     6    30      940        15     1216        -4 VX      N626VA     407\n2  2013     5     7     1657        -3     2104        10 DL      N3760C     329\n3  2013    12     8      859        -1     1238        11 DL      N712TW     422\n4  2013     5    14     1841        -4     2122       -34 DL      N914DL    2391\n5  2013     7    21     1102        -3     1230        -8 9E      N823AY    3652\n6  2013     1     1     1817        -3     2008         3 AA      N3AXAA     353\n# ℹ 6 more variables: origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   hour &lt;dbl&gt;, minute &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1: Fill in the code below to write a function that finds all flights that were cancelled or delayed by more than a user supplied number of hours:\n\nfilter_severe &lt;- function(df, hours) { \n  df |&gt; \n    filter(dep_delay _____)\n}\n\n\nnycflights |&gt; \n  filter_severe(hours = 2)\n\nQuestion 2: Fill in the code below to write a function that converts the user supplied variable that uses clock time (e.g., dep_time, arr_time, etc.) into a decimal time (i.e. hours + (minutes / 60)).\n\nstandardize_time &lt;- function(df, time_var) {\n  df |&gt; \n    # Times are stored as 2008 for 8\n    mutate( {{ time_var }} := \n              as.numeric(\n                ## Grab first two numbers for hour\n                str_sub(\n                  {{ time_var }}, \n                  start = 1, \n                  end = 2)\n                ) +  \n              as.numeric(\n                ## Grab second two numbers for minutes\n                str_sub(\n                  {{ time_var }}, \n                  start = 3, \n                  end = 4)\n                ) / 60\n            )\n  \n}\n\nnycflights |&gt; \n  standardize_time(arr_time)\n\nQuestion 3: For each of the following functions determine if the function uses data-masking or tidy-selection:\n\ndistinct()\ncount()\ngroup_by()\nselect()\nrename_with()\nacross()",
